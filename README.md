# autobudget
Because I got tired of writing code in Excel. And unit tests are cool.

## Purpose
We get paid twice a month, and I do the budget on those paydays. The math isn't hard, and over the years I've made 15 different spreadsheets trying to make it easier to do. But the the best spreadsheet is never as simple or robust as it could be.

But I also noticed that it's easy to neglect expenses that should be treated as savings/funds. For example, when your car breaks down it's not usually a $100 thing (or whatever your monthly budget is); it helps to save unused funds during the months when the car works well. But if you do that with ten different line items, the math becomes very cumbersome.

Also, all the services that download your transactions seem to be broken more often than they work.

## Usage

### Step 1: Create a Budget

### Step 2: Payday

### Step 3: Track Transactions

### Step 4: Retrospective
